# set-enforcement-action: Simple Example

### Overview

In this example, we will see how to set enforcement action for policy constraints to
dryrun for auditing purposes.

### Fetch the example package

Get the example package by running the following commands:

```shell
$ kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-functions-catalog.git/examples/set-enforcement-action-simple@set-enforcement-action/v0.1.0
```

### Function invocation

Invoke the function by running the following command:

```shell
$ kpt fn render set-enforcement-action-simple
```

### Expected result

The two policy constraints should have been mutated with their `spec.enforcementAction` 
elements set to `dryrun` which were initially set to `deny`

```yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sRestrictRoleBindings
metadata: # kpt-merge: /restrict-clusteradmin-rolebindings
  name: restrict-clusteradmin-rolebindings
  annotations:
    # This constraint is not certified by CIS.
    description: "Restricts use of the cluster-admin role."

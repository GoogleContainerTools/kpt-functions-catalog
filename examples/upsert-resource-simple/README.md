# upsert-resource: Simple Example

In this example, we will see how `upsert-resource` function replaces the
matching resource (identified by GKNN (Group, Kind, Namespace and Name)) in the
package with the input resource.

### Fetch the example package

Get the example package by running the following commands:

```shell
$ kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-functions-catalog.git/examples/upsert-resource-simple
```

Let's start with the list of resources in a package:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myService
  namespace: mySpace
spec:
  selector:
    app: foo
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myDeployment
  namespace: mySpace
spec:
  replicas: 3
```

Resource to upsert:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myService
  namespace: mySpace
spec:
  selector:
    app: bar
```

Invoking `upsert-resource` function replaces the resource with name `myService`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myService
  namespace: mySpace
spec:
  selector:
    app: bar
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myDeployment
  namespace: mySpace
spec:
  replicas: 3
```

### Function invocation

Invoke the function by running the following commands:

```shell
$ kpt fn eval -i upsert-resource:unstable --fn-config .expected/fn-config.yaml
```

### Expected result

Check the resource with name `myService` is replaced with input resource. The
value of field `app` is updated.

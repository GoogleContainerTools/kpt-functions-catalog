# enable-gcp-services: Advanced Example

### Overview

In this example, we will see how to generate [project services](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/serviceusage/service) for multiple projects and how service pruning is done.

### Fetch the example package

Get the example package by running the following commands:

```shell
$ kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-functions-catalog.git/examples/enable-gcp-services-advanced
```

Explore the package by running:
```shell
$ kpt pkg tree enable-gcp-services-advanced
Package "enable-gcp-services-advanced"
├── [Kptfile]  Kptfile enable-gcp-services-simple
├── [proj1-services.yaml]  ProjectServiceSet proj1-service
├── [proj2-services.yaml]  ProjectServiceSet proj2-service
├── [resources.yaml]  ComputeNetwork computenetwork-sample
├── [resources.yaml]  RedisInstance redisinstance-sample
├── [service_proj1-service-bigquery.yaml]  Service proj1-service-bigquery
├── [service_proj1-service-compute.yaml]  Service proj1-service-compute
├── [service_proj1-service-redis.yaml]  Service proj1-service-redis
└── [service_proj2-service-redis.yaml]  Service proj2-service-redis
```

We can see two ProjectServiceSet resources `proj1-service` and `proj2-service` for managing service enablement in two projects `proj1` and `proj2`. We can also see the services `compute.googleapis.com`, `redis.googleapis.com` managed within ProjectServiceSet `proj1-service` resource and `redis.googleapis.com` within ProjectServiceSet `proj2-service` resource. Notice that `bigquery.googleapis.com` is no longer present in `proj1-service` ProjectServiceSet. We can re render this package to prune that service resource.

### Function invocation

Render the configuration, `enable-gcp-services` has been defined declaratively in the Kptfile.

```shell
$ kpt fn render enable-gcp-services-advanced
```

### Expected result

```shell
Package "enable-gcp-services-advanced": 
[RUNNING] "gcr.io/kpt-fn/enable-gcp-services:unstable"
[PASS] "gcr.io/kpt-fn/enable-gcp-services:unstable"
  Results:

```

We can see that the `bigquery` service resource was pruned. Run the following command to see current service resources:

```shell
$ kpt pkg tree enable-gcp-services-advanced
```

We can see `proj1-service-bigquery` no longer exists.

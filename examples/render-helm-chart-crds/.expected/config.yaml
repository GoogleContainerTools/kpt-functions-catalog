# This test should be skipped because a bug in the kpt orchestrator
# results in non-idempotent behavior.

# Upon the first run, the contents of customresourcedefinition_workspaces.app.terraform.io.yaml
# contains the following:

#  creationTimestamp: null
#  name: workspaces.app.terraform.io

# On the second run, however, these fields are reversed:

#  name: workspaces.app.terraform.io
#  creationTimestamp: null

# kpt should preserve the ordering of fields. Ordering is preserved if creationTimestamp
# is anything except null (correct behavior), but is not preserved when creationTimestamp
# is null.

skip: true

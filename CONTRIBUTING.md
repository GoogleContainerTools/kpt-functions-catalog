# Contributing to kpt-functions-catalog

We'd love to accept your contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows [Google's Open Source Community Guidelines]
and a [Code of Conduct].

## How to Contribute

This catalog contains configuration functions to fetch, display, customize,
update, validate, and apply Kubernetes configuration. Contribute functions
to this catalog by making the following changes:

1. Make the code changes implementing the function and any unit tests. The code
   belongs under [functions/] in the appropriate directory.
2. Create an example of how to run your function and put it under [examples/].
3. Test running your function example imperatively and declaratively in
   [e2e tests]. These tests are run regularly and help catch regressions.
4. Document your function in the config functions catalog on the [kpt website]
   by following the [kpt contribution guidelines].
5. Reach out to the maintainers to publish the function.

Make PRs and request reviews for these changes. You can follow the pull request
changes below:

* [function implementation PR]
* [example and e2e test PR]
* [catalog documentation PR]

### Code Changes

#### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see

again.

#### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Documentation Changes

[kpt contribution guidelines] to make docs changes.

Changes to other documentation such as examples and README files can follow the
same pull request format as code changes.

```

For each function, its files spread in the follow places:

- `functions/` directory: Each function must have its own directory in one
  of `functions/` sub-directory. In each function's directory, it must have the
  following:
    - Source code (and unit tests).
    - A README.md file serving as the usage doc and will be shown in
      the [catalog website].
        - golang-based functions should follow [this template][golang-template].
        - typescript-based functions should follow [this template][ts-template].
    - A metadata.yaml file that follows the function metadata schema.
    - (Optional) A Dockerfile to build the docker container. If a Dockerfile is
      not defined, the [default Dockerfile for the language][docker-common] will
      be used.
- `examples/` directory: It contains examples for functions, and these examples
  are also being tested as e2e tests. Each function should have at least one
  example here. There must be a README.md file in each example directory, and it
  should follow the [template][example-template].
- The `tests/` directory contains additional e2e tests.
- `master` branch should should contain examples with the `unstable` tag for
  your function images.  When you release the function version that tag should 
  have the samples and tests that match the function version.

For golang-based functions, you need to generate some doc related variables from
the `README.md` by running

```shell
$ cd functions/go
$ make generate
```

### Tests

#### Unit Tests

To run all unit tests

```shell
$ make unit-test
```

#### Building a function image

Note: We use `docker buildx` to build images. Please ensure you have it installed.

To build all function images
```shell
$ make build
```

To build a single function image (e.g. `apply-setters`)
```shell
$ cd functions/go
$ make apply-setters-BUILD
```

#### E2E Tests

The e2e tests are the recommended way to test functions in the catalog. They are
very easy to write and set up with our e2e test harness. You can find all the
supported options and expected test directory
structure [here][e2e test harness doc].

You can choose to put the e2e test in either the `examples/` directory or in the
`tests/` directory depending on if it is worthwhile to be shown as an example.

**Note**: The e2e tests don't build the images. So you need to ensure you have built
the latest image(s) before running any e2e tests.

To test a specific example or the e2e test, run

```shell
$ cd tests/e2etest
$ go test -v ./... -run TestE2E/../../examples/$EXAMPLE_NAME
# To test the example in contrib
$ go test -v ./... -run TestE2E/../../contrib/examples/$EXAMPLE_NAME
```

If you encounter some test failure saying something like "actual diff doesn't
match expected" or "actual results doesn't match expected", you can update the
expected `diff.patch` or `results.yaml` by running the following commands:

```shell
# Update one example
$ KPT_E2E_UPDATE_EXPECTED=true go test -v ./... -run TestE2E/../../examples/$EXAMPLE_NAME
# Update one example in contrib 
$ KPT_E2E_UPDATE_EXPECTED=true go test -v ./... -run TestE2E/../../contrib/examples/$EXAMPLE_NAME

# Update all examples
$ KPT_E2E_UPDATE_EXPECTED=true go test -v ./...
```


Most contributors don't need this, but if you happen to need to test all
examples and e2e tests, run the following command

```shell
$ make e2e-test
```

#### Doc Verifier

We have a script to ensure the usage docs and the examples are consistent.
Please ensure it's passing by running:

```shell
$ ./scripts/verify-docs.py
```

This script requires Python 3, `pyyaml` and `mdrip` which is a CLI tool.

To install `pyyaml`, run the following command:

```shell
pip install pyyaml
```

To install `mdrip`, run the following commands:

```shell
$ go install github.com/monopole/mdrip@v1.0.2
```

And you need to ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH`.

### Change Existing Functions

You must follow the layout convention when you make changes to existing
functions.

If you implement a new feature, you must add a new example or modify existing
one to cover it.

If you fix a bug, you must add (unit or e2e) tests to cover that.

### Contribute New Functions

You must follow the layout convention when you contribute new functions.

You need to add new function name to the respective language Makefiles.

- `functions/go/Makefile` for golang.
- `functions/ts/Makefile` for typescript.

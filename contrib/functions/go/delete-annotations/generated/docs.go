var DeleteAnnotationsShort = `Deletes the supplied annotation keys from the resource(s).`
var DeleteAnnotationsLong = `
## Usage

You can delete multiple annotations provided as a comma separated string as part of the function config.

To execute imperatively:
  $ kpt fn eval -i gcr.io/kpt-fn-contrib/delete-annotations:unstable -- annotationKeys=annotation-to-delete,another-annotation-to-delete

To execute ` + "`" + `delete-annotations` + "`" + ` declaratively include the function in kpt package pipeline as follows:
  ...
  pipeline:
    mutators:
      - image: gcr.io/kpt-fn-contrib/delete-annotations:unstable
        configMap:
          annotationKeys: annotation-to-delete,another-annotation-to-delete
  ...

### FunctionConfig

This function takes the annotation key names as part of the function config parameter
` + "`" + `annotationKeys` + "`" + ` where the key names can be provided as comma separated values as follows:

` + "`" + `annotationKeys=annotation-key-1,annotation-key-2` + "`" + `

In the previous example, the function will delete annotations ` + "`" + `annotation-key-1` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `annotation-key-2` + "`" + `
in all resource(s) where those annotations are present.

The ` + "`" + `annotationKeys` + "`" + ` field is a required parameter.

# delete-annotations

## Overview

<!--mdtogo:Short-->

Deletes the supplied annotation keys from the resource(s) in a package.

<!--mdtogo-->

This function helps users remove annotations that are not necessary for deployment
across a package. E.g. a user may add annotations to resource(s) for local processing
but those annotations may not be necessary for deployment or for the functioning of the
workload. This function can be used to clean up such unnecessary annotations before
resources are deployed.

<!--mdtogo:Long-->

## Usage

You can delete multiple annotations provided as a comma separated string as part of the function config.

To execute imperatively:
```shell
$ kpt fn eval -i gcr.io/kpt-fn-contrib/delete-annotations:unstable -- annotationKeys=annotation.to.delete,another.annotation.to.delete
```

To execute `delete-annotations` declaratively include the function in kpt package pipeline as follows:
```yaml
...
pipeline:
  mutators:
    - image: gcr.io/kpt-fn-contrib/delete-annotations:unstable
      configMap:
        annotationKeys: annotation.to.delete,another.annotation.to.delete
...
```

### FunctionConfig

This function takes the annotation key names as part of the function config parameter
`annotationKeys` where the key names can be provided as comma separated values as follows:

`annotationKeys=annotation.key.1,annotation.key.2`

In the previous example, the function will delete annotations `annotation.key.1` and `annotation.key.2`
in all resource(s) where those annotations are present.

The `annotationKeys` field is a required parameter.

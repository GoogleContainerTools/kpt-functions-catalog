var SetLabelsShort = `The ` + "`" + `set-labels` + "`" + ` function adds a list of [labels] to all resources. It's a
common practice to add a set of labels for all the resource in a package.
Kubernetes has some [recommended labels].

For example, labels can be used in the following scenarios:

- Identify the KRM resources by querying their labels.
- Set labels for all resources within a package (e.g. environment=staging).`
var SetLabelsLong = `
There are 2 kinds of ` + "`" + `functionConfig` + "`" + ` supported by this function:

- ` + "`" + `ConfigMap` + "`" + `
- A custom resource of kind ` + "`" + `SetLabels` + "`" + `

To use a ` + "`" + `ConfigMap` + "`" + ` as the ` + "`" + `functionConfig` + "`" + `, the desired labels must be
specified in the ` + "`" + `data` + "`" + ` field.

To add 2 labels ` + "`" + `color: orange` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `fruit: apple` + "`" + ` to all resources, we use the
following ` + "`" + `functionConfig` + "`" + `:

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: my-config
  data:
    color: orange
    fruit: apple

To use a ` + "`" + `SetLabels` + "`" + ` custom resource as the ` + "`" + `functionConfig` + "`" + `, the desired labels
must be specified in the ` + "`" + `labels` + "`" + ` field. You can optionally
use ` + "`" + `additionalLabelFields` + "`" + ` to specify the additional fields you want to update.
It will be used jointly with the [defaults][commonlabels].
` + "`" + `additionalLabelFields` + "`" + ` has following fields:

- ` + "`" + `group` + "`" + `: Select the resources by API version group. Will select all groups if
  omitted.
- ` + "`" + `version` + "`" + `: Select the resources by API version. Will select all versions if
  omitted.
- ` + "`" + `kind` + "`" + `: Select the resources by resource kind. Will select all kinds if
  omitted.
- ` + "`" + `path` + "`" + `: Specify the path to the field that the value needs to be updated. This
  field is required.
- ` + "`" + `create` + "`" + `: If it's set to true, the field specified will be created if it
  doesn't exist. Otherwise, the function will only update the existing field.

To add 2 labels ` + "`" + `color: orange` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `fruit: apple` + "`" + ` to all built-in resources and
the path ` + "`" + `data.selector` + "`" + ` in ` + "`" + `MyOwnKind` + "`" + ` resource, we use the
following ` + "`" + `functionConfig` + "`" + `:

  apiVersion: fn.kpt.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: SetLabels
  metadata:
    name: my-config
  labels:
    color: orange
    fruit: apple
  additionalLabelFields:
    - path: data/selector
      kind: MyOwnKind
      create: true
`

var EnableGcpServicesShort = `The ` + "`" + `enable-gcp-services` + "`" + ` function generates [GCP project service](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/serviceusage/service)
resources from a list of services to enable [GCP APIs](https://cloud.google.com/apis) within a specified project. This allows users to succinctly define all
the services necessary in a single resource and have tighter control over which services are enabled in a specific project.`
var EnableGcpServicesLong = `
## Usage

` + "`" + `enable-gcp-services` + "`" + ` function can be used both declaratively and imperatively.

  $ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/enable-gcp-services:unstable

The ` + "`" + `enable-gcp-services` + "`" + ` function does the following:

1. Discovers all ` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + ` custom resources in a given package and nested packages if any.

1. For each ` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + ` CR, it generates [GCP project service](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/serviceusage/service) resources as specified in the ` + "`" + `spec.services` + "`" + ` list.
    * Adds all annotations defined for ` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + ` CR to each generated resource. This can be used for enabling features like
[disable-on-destroy](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/serviceusage/service#custom_resource_definition_properties) for generated services.
    * Sets namespace if any defined for ` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + ` CR to each generated resource.
    * Sets projectID if any defined for ` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + ` CR to each generated resource.
1. Each generated [GCP project service](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/serviceusage/service) resource
has a ` + "`" + `blueprints.cloud.google.com/ownerReference` + "`" + ` annotation. This annotation allows ` + "`" + `enable-gcp-services` + "`" + ` function to
track generated resources for the declarative management of the generated resources. Any changes made to the generate resources will be overwritten and should be made to the ` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + ` CR instead.

### ` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + `

This function only supports local-config custom resources of kind ` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + ` and can be provided using input items along with other KRM resources. Multiple ` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + ` CRs can be declared in a package.

` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + ` has the following supported parameters:

  apiVersion: blueprints.cloud.google.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ProjectServiceSet
  metadata:
    name: my-project-services
    annotations:
      cnrm.cloud.google.com/deletion-policy: "false"
      config.kubernetes.io/local-config: "true"
  spec:
    services: # list of services to generate
      - compute.googleapis.com
    projectID: foo

| Field        |  Description | Example | Required
| -----------: |  ----------- | ----------- | -----------
` + "`" + `spec.services[]` + "`" + `    | A list of GCP services to enable | [compute.googleapis.com,bigquery.googleapis.com] | yes
` + "`" + `spec.projectID` + "`" + `   | Project ID where the services should be enabled. | my-project-id | no
`
var EnableGcpServicesExamples = `
Let's start with a ` + "`" + `ProjectServiceSet` + "`" + ` CR for enabling two services ` + "`" + `compute.googleapis.com` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `redis.googleapis.com` + "`" + ` in a GCP Project ` + "`" + `proj1` + "`" + `.

  # services-config.yaml
  apiVersion: blueprints.cloud.google.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ProjectServiceSet
  metadata:
    name: proj1-service
    annotations:
      config.kubernetes.io/local-config: "true"
  spec:
    services:
      - compute.googleapis.com
      - redis.googleapis.com
    projectID: proj1

Invoke the function:

  $ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/enable-gcp-services:unstable

Generated resources looks like the following:

  # service_proj1-service-compute.yaml
  apiVersion: serviceusage.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: proj1-service-compute
    annotations:
      blueprints.cloud.google.com/ownerReference: 'blueprints.cloud.google.com/ProjectServiceSet/proj1-service'
  spec:
    resourceID: compute.googleapis.com
    projectRef:
      external: proj1

  # service_proj1-service-redis.yaml
  apiVersion: serviceusage.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: proj1-service-redis
    annotations:
      blueprints.cloud.google.com/ownerReference: 'blueprints.cloud.google.com/ProjectServiceSet/proj1-service'
  spec:
    resourceID: redis.googleapis.com
    projectRef:
      external: proj1
`

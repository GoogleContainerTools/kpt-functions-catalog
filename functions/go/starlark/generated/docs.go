### Function

[starlark] function contains an interpreter for the Starlark language. You can
provide a Starlark script in the ` + "`" + `functionConfig` + "`" + ` to mutate or validate your
resources. It is a light-weight way to write a KRM function. It is recommended
to only build simple function with it. Generally, if you Starlark script is
longer than 20 lines, you may want to consider build a function with our
[Golang SDK] or [TypeScript SDK].

### FunctionConfig

The starlark function accepts a CRD of kind ` + "`" + `StarlarkRun` + "`" + ` as the
` + "`" + `functionConfig` + "`" + `. It looks like this:

  apiVersion: fn.kpt.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: StarlarkRun
  metadata:
    name: my-star-fn
  source: |
    # Starlark source lives here.
    # You can mutate or validate the resources in ctx.resource_list["items"].

` + "`" + `StarlarkRun` + "`" + ` has the following field besides the standard KRM fields:
- ` + "`" + `source` + "`" + `: (required) A multi-line string that contains the source code of the
  Starlark script.
`

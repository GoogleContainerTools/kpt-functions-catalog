[Starlark] is a dialect of Python. It is commonly used as a configuration language. It is an untyped dynamic language with
high-level data types, first-class functions with lexical scope, and garbage
collection.

The starlark function currently uses ` + "`" + `StarlarkRun` + "`" + ` as the function config. It
looks like this:

  apiVersion: fn.kpt.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: StarlarkRun
  metadata:
    name: my-star-fn
  source: |
    # set the namespace on each resource
    def run(resources, ns_value):
      for resource in resources:
      # mutate the resource
      resource["metadata"]["namespace"] = ns_value
    run(ctx.resource_list["items"], "prod")

` + "`" + `StarlarkRun` + "`" + ` has the following field beside the standard KRM fields:
- ` + "`" + `source` + "`" + `: (required) The source code of the Starlark script.

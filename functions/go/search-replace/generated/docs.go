var SearchReplaceShort = `Search and optionally replace field values.

There is a spectrum of configuration customization techniques as described in
[this document]. One of the most basic and simplest customization techniques is Search and Replace.
The user fetches a package of resources, searches all the files for fields matching
a criteria, and replaces their values.`
var SearchReplaceLong = `
Search matchers are provided with ` + "`" + `by-` + "`" + ` prefix. When multiple matchers
are provided they are AND’ed together.

Mutators are provided with ` + "`" + `put-` + "`" + ` prefix. When multiple mutators
are provided they are all applied.

Matchers:

  by-value
  Match by value of a field.
  
  by-value-regex
  Match by Regex for the value of a field. The syntax of the regular expressions
  accepted is the same general syntax used by Go, Perl, Python, and other languages.
  More precisely, it is the syntax accepted by RE2 and described at
  https://golang.org/s/re2syntax. With the exception that it matches the entire
  value of the field by default without requiring start (^) and end ($) characters.
  
  by-path
  Match by path expression of a field. Path expressions are used to deeply navigate
  and match particular yaml nodes. Please note that the field path expressions are not
  regular expressions.
  
  by-file-path
  Match by file path expression. Input must be OS-agnostic Slash(/) separated file path
  relative to the directory on which the function is invoked. Please note that the
  file path expressions are not regular expressions.

Mutators:

  put-value
  Set or update the value of the matching fields. Input can be a pattern for which
  the numbered capture groups are resolved using --by-value-regex input.
  
  put-comment
  Set or update the line comment for matching fields. Input can be a pattern for
  which the numbered capture groups are resolved using --by-value-regex input.

We use ConfigMap to configure the ` + "`" + `search-replace` + "`" + ` function. The inputs are
provided as key-value pairs using ` + "`" + `data` + "`" + ` field.

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: search-replace-fn-config
  data:
    by-path: metadata.name
    by-value: the-deployment
    put-value: my-deployment

The function can be invoked using:

  $ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable --fn-config /path/to/fn-config.yaml

Alternatively, data can be passed as key-value pairs in the CLI

  $ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable -- 'by-path=metadata.name' 'put-value=the-deployment'

### Field path patterns

` + "`" + `by-path` + "`" + ` matcher supports the following patterns:

| Special Terms | Meaning                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| ` + "`" + `*` + "`" + `           | matches exactly one field   |
| ` + "`" + `**` + "`" + `          | matches zero or more fields |

  a.b.c
  
  a:
    b:
      c: thing # MATCHES

  a.*.c
  
  a:
    b1:
      c: thing # MATCHES
      d: whatever
    b2:
      c: thing # MATCHES
      f: something irrelevant

  a.**.c
  
  a:
    b1:
      c: thing1 # MATCHES
      d: cat
    b2:
      c: thing2 # MATCHES
      d: dog
    b3:
      d:
      - f:
          c: thing3 # MATCHES
          d: beep
      - f:
          g:
            c: thing4 # MATCHES
            d: boop
      - d: mooo

  a.b[1].c
  
  a:
    b:
    - c: thing0
    - c: thing1 # MATCHES
    - c: thing2

  a.b[*].c
  
  a:
    b:
    - c: thing0 # MATCHES
      d: what..ever
    - c: thing1 # MATCHES
      d: blarh
    - c: thing2 # MATCHES
      f: thingamabob

### File path patterns

` + "`" + `by-file-path` + "`" + ` matcher supports the following special terms in the patterns:

| Special Terms | Meaning                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ` + "`" + `*` + "`" + `           | matches any sequence of non-path-separators                                                               |
| ` + "`" + `**` + "`" + `          | matches zero or more directories                                                                          |
| ` + "`" + `?` + "`" + `           | matches any single non-path-separator character                                                           |
| ` + "`" + `[class]` + "`" + `     | matches any single non-path-separator character against a class of characters ([see "character classes"]) |
| ` + "`" + `{alt1,...}` + "`" + `  | matches a sequence of characters if one of the comma-separated alternatives matches                       |

Any character with a special meaning can be escaped with a backslash (` + "`" + `\` + "`" + `).

A mid-pattern doublestar (` + "`" + `**` + "`" + `) behaves like bash's globstar option: a pattern
such as ` + "`" + `path/to/**.txt` + "`" + ` would return the same results as ` + "`" + `path/to/*.txt` + "`" + `. The
pattern you're looking for is ` + "`" + `path/to/**/*.txt` + "`" + `.

Character Classes:

Character classes support the following:

| Class      | Meaning                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ` + "`" + `[abc]` + "`" + `    | matches any single character within the set                   |
| ` + "`" + `[a-z]` + "`" + `    | matches any single character in the range                     |
| ` + "`" + `[^class]` + "`" + ` | matches any single character which does _not_ match the class |
| ` + "`" + `[!class]` + "`" + ` | same as ` + "`" + `^` + "`" + `: negates the class                                |

# search-replace

### Overview

<!--mdtogo:Short-->

Search and optionally replace field values.

There is a spectrum of configuration customization techniques as described in
[this document]. One of the most basic and simplest customization techniques is Search and Replace.
The user fetches a package of resources, searches all the files for fields matching
a criteria, and replaces their values.

<!--mdtogo-->

### FunctionConfig

<!--mdtogo:Long-->

Search matchers are provided with `by-` prefix. When multiple matchers
are provided they are ANDâ€™ed together.

Mutators are provided with `put-` prefix. When multiple mutators
are provided they are all applied.

#### Matchers

```
by-value
Match by value of a field.

by-value-regex
Match by Regex for the value of a field. The syntax of the regular expressions
accepted is the same general syntax used by Go, Perl, Python, and other languages.
More precisely, it is the syntax accepted by RE2 and described at
https://golang.org/s/re2syntax. With the exception that it matches the entire
value of the field by default without requiring start (^) and end ($) characters.

by-path
Match by path expression of a field. Path expressions are used to deeply navigate
and match particular yaml nodes. Please note that the field path expressions are not
regular expressions.

by-file-path
Match by file path expression. Input must be OS-agnostic Slash(/) separated file path
relative to the directory on which the function is invoked. Please note that the
file path expressions are not regular expressions.
```

#### Mutators

```
put-value
Set or update the value of the matching fields. Input can be a pattern for which
the numbered capture groups are resolved using --by-value-regex input.

put-comment
Set or update the line comment for matching fields. Input can be a pattern for
which the numbered capture groups are resolved using --by-value-regex input.
```

We use ConfigMap to configure the `search-replace` function. The inputs are
provided as key-value pairs using `data` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: search-replace-fn-config
data:
  by-path: metadata.name
  by-value: the-deployment
  put-value: my-deployment
```

The function can be invoked using:

```shell
$ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable --fn-config /path/to/fn-config.yaml
```

Alternatively, data can be passed as key-value pairs in the CLI

```shell
$ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable -- 'by-path=metadata.name' 'put-value=the-deployment'
```

### Field path patterns

`--by-path` matcher supports the following patterns:

```yaml
a.b.c

a:
  b:
    c: thing # MATCHES
```

```yaml
a.*.c

a:
  b1:
    c: thing # MATCHES
    d: whatever
  b2:
    c: thing # MATCHES
    f: something irrelevant
```

```yaml
a.**.c

a:
  b1:
    c: thing1 # MATCHES
    d: cat
  b2:
    c: thing2 # MATCHES
    d: dog
  b3:
    d:
    - f:
        c: thing3 # MATCHES
        d: beep
    - f:
        g:
          c: thing4 # MATCHES
          d: boop
    - d: mooo
```

```yaml
a.b[1].c

a:
  b:
  - c: thing0
  - c: thing1 # MATCHES
  - c: thing2
```

```yaml
a.b[*].c

a:
  b:
  - c: thing0 # MATCHES
    d: what..ever
  - c: thing1 # MATCHES
    d: blarh
  - c: thing2 # MATCHES
    f: thingamabob
```

### File path patterns

`--by-file-path` matcher supports the following special terms in the patterns:

| Special Terms | Meaning                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*`           | matches any sequence of non-path-separators                                                               |
| `/**/`        | matches zero or more directories                                                                          |
| `?`           | matches any single non-path-separator character                                                           |
| `[class]`     | matches any single non-path-separator character against a class of characters ([see "character classes"]) |
| `{alt1,...}`  | matches a sequence of characters if one of the comma-separated alternatives matches                       |

Any character with a special meaning can be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

A doublestar (`**`) should appear surrounded by path separators such as `/**/`.
A mid-pattern doublestar (`**`) behaves like bash's globstar option: a pattern
such as `path/to/**.txt` would return the same results as `path/to/*.txt`. The
pattern you're looking for is `path/to/**/*.txt`.

#### Character Classes

Character classes support the following:

| Class      | Meaning                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[abc]`    | matches any single character within the set                   |
| `[a-z]`    | matches any single character in the range                     |
| `[^class]` | matches any single character which does _not_ match the class |
| `[!class]` | same as `^`: negates the class                                |

### Examples

<!--mdtogo:Examples-->

```shell
# Matches fields with value "3":
$ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable -- by-value=3
```

```shell
# Matches fields with value prefixed by "nginx-":
$ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable -- by-value-regex='ngnix-.*'
```

```shell
# Matches field with path "spec.namespaces" set to "bookstore":
$ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable -- by-path='metadata.namespace' by-value='bookstore'
```

```shell
# Matches fields with name "containerPort" arbitrarily deep in "spec" that have value of 80:
$ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable -- by-path='spec.**.containerPort' by-value=80
```

```shell
# Set namespaces for all resources to "bookstore", even namespace is not set on a resource:
$ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable -- by-path='metadata.namespace' put-value='bookstore'
```

```shell
# Update the setter value "project-id" to value "new-project" in all "setters.yaml" files in the current directory tree:
kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable --include-meta-resources -- \
by-value=project-id by-file-path='**/setters.yaml' put-value=new-project
```

```shell
# Search and Set multiple values using regex numbered capture groups
$ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable -- by-value-regex='something-(.*)' put-value='my-project-id-${1}'
metadata:
  name: something-foo
  namespace: something-bar
...
metadata:
  name: my-project-id-foo
  namespace: my-project-id-bar
```

#### Create setters examples

```shell
# Put the setter pattern as a line comment for matching fields.
$ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable -- by-value='my-project-id-foo' put-comment='kpt-set: ${project-id}-foo'
metadata:
  name: my-project-id-foo # kpt-set: ${project-id}-foo

# Setter pattern comments can be added to multiple values matching a regex numbered capture groups
$ kpt fn eval --image gcr.io/kpt-fn/search-replace:unstable -- by-value-regex='my-project-id-(.*)' put-comment='kpt-set: ${project-id}-${1}'
metadata:
  name: my-project-id-foo # kpt-set: ${project-id}-foo
  namespace: my-project-id-bar # kpt-set: ${project-id}-bar
```

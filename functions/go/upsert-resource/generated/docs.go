Upsert is an operation that adds a resource(uniquely identified by Group, Kind, Name and Namespace)
if it does not already exist, or replaces it if it already exists in the input list of resources.
` + "`" + `upsert-resource` + "`" + ` function offers a safe way to upsert a resource to the list of input resources.

Replace an existing resource:

Let's start with the list of resources in a package:

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: myService
    namespace: mySpace
  spec:
    selector:
      app: foo
  ---
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: myDeployment
    namespace: mySpace
  spec:
    replicas: 3

Resource to upsert:

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: myService
    namespace: mySpace
  spec:
    selector:
      app: bar

Invoking ` + "`" + `upsert-resource` + "`" + ` function replaces the resource with name ` + "`" + `myService` + "`" + `:

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: myService
    namespace: mySpace
  spec:
    selector:
      app: bar
  ---
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: myDeployment
    namespace: mySpace
  spec:
    replicas: 3

Add a new resource:

For the same input resource list above, pass the following resource to upsert.
Note that the name of the resource is ` + "`" + `myService2` + "`" + `.

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: myService2
    namespace: mySpace
  spec:
    selector:
      app: bar

Invoking ` + "`" + `upsert-resource` + "`" + ` function adds the input resource to the package.

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: myService
    namespace: mySpace
  spec:
    selector:
      app: foo
  ---
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: myDeployment
    namespace: mySpace
  spec:
    replicas: 3
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: myService2
    namespace: mySpace
  spec:
    selector:
      app: bar

    # Google Cloud Foundation Blueprint

    This directory contains Terraform configuration for a foundational environment on Google Cloud.

    It includes a subset of resources configured via the [setup checklist](https://cloud.google.com/docs/enterprise/setup-checklist)
    and is based on the [security foundations blueprint](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations).

    ## Prerequisites

    To run the commands described in this document, you need to have the following
    installed:

    - The [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) version 319.0.0 or later
    - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 0.13.7 or later.

    1. Set up a Google Cloud
       [organization](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization).
    1. Set up a Google Cloud
       [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account).
    1. Created Cloud Identity or Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) groups for
       organization and billing admins.
    1. For the user who will run the procedures in this document, granted the
       following roles:
       -  The `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` role on the Google
          Cloud organization.
       -  The `roles/billing.admin` role on the billing account.
       -  The `roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator` role.
       -  The `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` role.

    ## Deploying

    1. Run `terraform init`.
    1. Run `terraform plan` and review the output.
    1. Run `terraform apply`.

    ## Next steps

    Once you have the basic foundation deployed, you should explore:
    1. Building an [advanced foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation) using the security blueprint
    2. Automatically deploying Terraform with [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/managing-infrastructure-as-code)

var GatekeeperShort = `Validate the KRM resources using [Gatekeeper] constraints.`
var GatekeeperLong = `
You can use Gatekeeper to validate KRM resources. To learn more about how to use
the Gatekeeper project, see: https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/howto.

The function evaluates constraint policies against KRM resources.
The function takes 3 types of resources from the input resource list:

- constraint templates
- constraints
- other KRM resources

Every constraint should be backed by a constraint template that defines the
schema and logic of the constraint.

To learn more about how to write constraint templates and constraints, see:

and

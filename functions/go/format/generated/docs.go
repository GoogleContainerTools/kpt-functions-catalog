var FormatShort = `Format the field ordering in resources.`
var FormatLong = `
The ` + "`" + `format` + "`" + ` function formats the field ordering in YAML configuration files. Field
ordering follows the ordering defined in the OpenAPI document for Kubernetes resources,
falling back on lexicographical sorting for unrecognized fields. This function also performs
other changes like fixing indentation, adding quotes to ambiguous string values.
`
var FormatExamples = `
Format a package:

Let's start with the input resource in a package.

  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    annotations:
      bar: 100
    name: nginx-deployment
  spec:
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.0.0
            ports:
              - containerPort: 80
                name: http

Invoke the ` + "`" + `format` + "`" + ` function on the package, formatted resource looks like the following:

  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: nginx-deployment
    annotations:
      bar: "100"
  spec:
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.0.0
            ports:
              - name: http
                containerPort: 80

The fields are ordered as per the OpenAPI schema definition of ` + "`" + `Deployment` + "`" + ` resource. For e.g. ` + "`" + `metadata.name` + "`" + ` field
is moved up. Since the type of annotation value is ` + "`" + `string` + "`" + `, quotes are added to value ` + "`" + `100` + "`" + ` as it will be interpreted
as ` + "`" + `int` + "`" + ` by yaml in its current form.
